## Deep Learning paper and algorithm implementations

This repo collects exercises and provides code for deep learning papers and algorithms. Implementations are loosely organized by topic and grouped into folders. In addition to implementations, each folder contains a README with learning goals and a list of exercises. Both folders and exercises are arranged in increasing order of complexity.

All code is written in Python 3 and implementations are in either TensorFlow or PyTorch.
