### About

This repo provides code, exercises, and solutions for common deep learning algorithms.

All code is written in Python 3 and implementations are either in TensorFlow or PyTorch.

### Table of Contents

_TODO: how to break this down into categories?_

- Numerical linear algebra
- Probability theory
- CNNs
- RNNs
- NIPS 17 implementations

### List of Implemented Algorithms

- Pick a cool paper from NIPS. Build up to implementing it by doing any related homeworks.
